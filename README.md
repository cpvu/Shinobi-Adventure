## Building the game
The game was built in a very short period of time of 2 weeks in a team of 2 developers (Calvin Vu and Hanxiao Mao) for our end of term Python project. In this period of time, we were able to build a game with fully working elements and comonents that were modularized. We were able to complete full documentation and implemented a suite of unit tests and docstring tests to ensure proper functioning of our game. We are proud of what we built in the short period of time and perhaps will revisit to the game to improve it in the future!
